# Server Crash Monitor

Run this script to reboot your server whenever it is at the verge of crashing. This little script has helped me to keep a lot of my high-load servers up.

Tested to work on Ubuntu Servers.

# Usage

Change `hostmaster@example.com` to your email address to get notification whenever your server is rebooted.
Run `install.sh`. You can also copy and paste its content to the terminal.
